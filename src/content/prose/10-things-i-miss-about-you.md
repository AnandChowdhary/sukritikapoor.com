_(Originally written on 29th November, 2018)_

10\. Caressing your neck

9\. Running my fingers through your hair whenever you drove and I messed up the navigation, alongside a duet of Abba or just anything from the 70s

8\. Fish kissing and being chubby together

7\. Your head in my lap

6\. Cuddling and sleeping off in cab rides

5\. Resting my head on your chest

4\. You kissing my neck from behind when we spooned

3\. Sitting on your lap

2\. Hugging you, whenever I wanted to, for however long I wished

1\. Kissing you, always

0\. You
