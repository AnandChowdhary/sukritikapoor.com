I realise that I'm probably not the most appropriate person to write this, considering that I'm in the middle of exams, pulling an all nighter because that third cup of coffee was not really the best idea (here's to sleeping till lunch tomorrow), and have just finished eating a cinnamon roll. But, if you're anything like me and can only think about leftover pizza at 5 am in the morning, you're probably going to want to read this.

1. **Always take the stairs**
   Squeezing in a little cardio and exercise, even in your busy routine works best for those who just can't wake up an hour early every morning to hit the gym. It's always a plus point if your office just refuses to get the lift fixed and the metro station escalators have been out of order for over a year.

2. **Kickstart your day**
   A heavy breakfast of protein and fiber can go a long way. You can look forward to a day full of energy and kiss that lethargy goodbye. An added bonus, it also helps drain the pipes better (If you're like Piku, this will really help a lot). A personal favourite is veggies, eggs, toast and OJ, just like every three course breakfast recipe you just watched before dozing off. Of course, if you're just running late and can't for your life think of cooking in the morning then day old dal and daliya work fine too.

3. **Don't give in to the Id**
   If you're anything like me, you know what I'm talking about. The classic 'Indulge and Devour', or as good ol' grampa Freud liked to call it, Id. Every time you get a craving, substitute for something similar but healthy. Chips and dip? Carrots and yogurt. Sugar cookies and cream? Candied apple and peanut butter. And the list goes on. Always pick honey over sugar and baking over frying, it really does make all the difference. And remember, don't just inhale your food, you want to spend so long eating that you get tired of eating itself. 20 minutes or more, always. You can put on a nice sitcom to help you get through it.

4. **Hide your nutrients**
   You heard it. No matter how close your IIT JEE rank was, your brain can still be really stupid and easy to trick sometimes. May it be feta cheese and berry pancakes, blended pasta sauces, veggie mac and cheese (yes, that's a thing), berry smoothies, spinach and mushroom frittatas (it's way better than a denver omelette), chili with brown rice, or even a cauliflower grilled cheese, your brain won't be able to tell a thing. It's the perfect way to eat junk, without really eating junk.

5. **Avoid hungry owl calls**
   It all goes perfectly to plan when you have an evening stroll, a light early dinner and lights off by 10 pm. But, oh wait, things start to go south when it's 2 am in the morning and sleep is ever evading on your hungry stomach. Well, fret not. The best way to avoid late night snacking is by making sure you feel really full at the end of dinner. Adding fruits, yogurt and a good amount of fiber can help you get those sweet hours of undisturbed sleep you really need. And if unavoidable, refer to point number 3 and 4 for healthy options. It's almost always unavoidable for me.

6. **Not over, not under, just enough**
   Moderation is the key to everything. Be it food, exercise or sleep. The latter might be a tough nut to crack but pulling in all nighters or 14 hour sleep days after is not always the road to fitness. Also, learn to moderate elixirs, be it your daily dose of caffeine or alcohol. Try not to mix the two; there's a reason jagerbombs never turn out like they're supposed to.

I hope these amateur tips really help you scale your way to your dream weight and not be skinny fat anymore.
