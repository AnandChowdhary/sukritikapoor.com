During my undergraduate studies, I consulted for Unifiers, a social infrastructure company working at the grassroots level to empower communities through skill development and vocational training across India.

My work at Unifiers was multifaceted. I edited and proofread their vocational training textbooks — manuals designed to teach practical skills to young people in underserved communities. This required careful attention to clarity and accessibility, since the content needed to be understood by readers from diverse educational backgrounds.

Beyond proofreading, I wrote feature articles for *Skilled*, Unifiers' magazine. These features told the stories of grassroots entrepreneurs and skilled youth whose lives had been transformed through vocational training. I traveled to meet these individuals, listened to their journeys, and wove their experiences into compelling narratives that showcased the real impact of skill development on the ground.

I also worked on a book pitch for Unifiers, helping them conceptualise a publication that would bring together the organisation's mission, impact stories, and vision for the future of skill development in India.

This experience was deeply rewarding because it combined my love for writing and editing with meaningful social impact. It showed me how the power of words can extend far beyond the page — helping organisations tell their stories and, in turn, helping communities tell theirs.
