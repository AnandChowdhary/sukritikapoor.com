Poetry has always been my most intimate form of expression. Over the years, I've written poems about love, identity, womanhood, consent, dreams, and everything in between. In 2020, I decided to take the leap and compile my work into a collection — and that's how *Crimson and Other Poems* was born.

*Crimson and Other Poems* is a softbound, 91-page paperback that brings together poems spanning themes of self-discovery, longing, resilience, and the beauty of everyday moments. The title poem, "Crimson," is one that's particularly close to my heart, and it felt like the perfect name for a collection that explores the many shades of human emotion.

Self-publishing was a journey in itself. From selecting and arranging the poems to designing the cover and navigating the world of print-on-demand, I wore many hats — writer, editor, designer, and marketer all at once. It taught me so much about the publishing process from the other side of the desk, having already worked in traditional publishing at DK.

The book is available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.in/dp/9357011463) and [Flipkart](https://www.flipkart.com/crimson-other-poems/p/itme3d3b883ee09c), and many of the poems from the collection can also be found in the [Poetry](/poetry) section of this website.
