While working at DK as an Assistant Editor, I got the incredible opportunity to contribute as a writer to one of our own publications. My short story "The Seven-Legged Beast" was published in DK's *[Birds and Beasts](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/675522/birds-and-beasts-by-dk/)* in 2020.

*Birds and Beasts* is a beautifully illustrated collection of enchanting tales from India, drawing from classic texts like the Hitopadesha, the Kathasaritsagara, and the Puranas, as well as oral tales from regions across the country — from Ladakh and Assam to Andhra Pradesh and Uttarakhand. The book also features tribal folklore from the Santal and Khasi communities.

For my story, I drew inspiration from *Folk-Tales of Kashmir* by James Hinton Knowles, a 19th-century collection of Kashmiri folklore. I came across the tale of a mysterious seven-legged beast and was immediately captivated by its strangeness and magic. I reimagined the story for a modern audience while staying true to the spirit of the original folk tale — a beast that appears during a royal procession, leading to a thrilling encounter with a shape-shifting jinn.

It was a wonderful experience to step into the role of storyteller after spending so much time as an editor, and to contribute to a book that brings India's rich oral traditions to young readers around the world.
