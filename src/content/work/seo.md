I realised the importance of SEO many years ago when I created the first version of my website and tried to search for it on Google and see where it came up in the list. As a content writer, I frequently read about SEO practices and implement them across my web-content career, whether it's writing and editing company blogs or writing webpage content.

In my internship at Eurail, I not only edit and update web content using Adobe Experience manager but also update webpage properties to follow optimal SEO practices for search engines and social media. I also edit magazine articles for SEO, readability, grammar, and style. Currently, I have edited seven articles about local tips for popular destinations across Europe.

Prior to this, I undertook an SEO revamp of VTubing and avatar social media app Hyper Online's "How to" guides, bringing their average SEO score from 50 to 90/100. I also edited them for readability, grammar, and style, and explained technical concepts in a simple and easy to understand manner for their target audience.
