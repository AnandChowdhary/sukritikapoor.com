My writing journey began in the fast-paced world of journalism. During my undergraduate studies, I interned at Hindustan Times, one of India's largest national dailies, where I got my first real taste of reporting from the field.

At Hindustan Times, I published 11 news stories on a range of topics — from the struggles of homeless shelter residents in Delhi to the success stories of student entrepreneurs building businesses while still in college. Each story required going out into the city, talking to real people, and distilling their experiences into compelling narratives that could fit the newspaper's format. It was an invaluable crash course in writing under tight deadlines, verifying facts, and finding the human angle in every story.

I also interned at Press Trust of India (PTI), India's premier wire news agency, where I learned the discipline of concise, accurate writing that wire journalism demands. Every word counts when your copy is being picked up by newspapers and news channels across the country.

After these internships, I took on a full-time role at Inshorts, an innovative news startup that condenses news stories into 60-word summaries. Working at Inshorts sharpened my ability to identify the most essential information in a story and communicate it with remarkable brevity — a skill that has served me well in every writing role since.

These early journalism experiences shaped my writing fundamentally. They taught me to listen carefully, write clearly, and always put the reader first.
