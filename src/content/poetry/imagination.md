Have you ever pinned your hopes on something,

This one thing that you just wished would work out all along

That destiny would have in store for you a recreation

Of that exact scene that you see in your mind

When you close your eyes each time a tear drops by

When it doesn't matter if all else around you fails

But even a hint of failure around that little something

Sends you spiraling down to an abyss of your own creation

Fueled by your own expectations

Run by your deepest insecurities

And held on by your desire; to think

That life must not all be so dark

That this is not the end, even if it feels like it is

That this is just a change in your journey

To reach that perfect life that you always imagined

Why must one have this 'perfect life'?

Because it hurts so much to not have anything to live for

To know that when it feels like the end, it is

To know that life is just that dark

And that you're just moving farther from that perfect life you imagined

And so I pray that we all forget this scene

Erase it slowly

Erode the edges

Slash through the center

And maybe once you've forgotten it

You'll finally start to live the life you're living

All else was just poor imagination
