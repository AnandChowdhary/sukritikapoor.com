I sit in a blocked in room

For eight hours, five days

Stare at a screen whose brightness pinches the corneas of my eyes

Write mindless words, numb sentences

I nod,

Always say 'yes'

I stutter as I falter about

And I struggle to get up from my desk

For a cup of barely steamed flavoured water in the garb of tea

Must be my only salvage

As if to stretch my eyes apart through wooden sticks

Don't blink for too long,

Or look down

Always have energy

Be energetic about new rules

Being imposed without reason, cause or effect

Don't talk to him, or look at her

Don't look outside

The windows offer a mere mirage of an escape

Into the outside world which is seemingly always bustling with noise

A truck rumbles by on the highway with bollywood music

And a man yells when a car horns at him three times…

To move

But stay still

Stay still or too much movement will mean you're reckless

Don't smile, don't laugh and don't cry

Emotions are not to be brought in with the lunch

Pick them back up at the staircase that heads down when the day ends

And the world outside doesn't seem that inviting anymore

I look for the shortest route home

Walk fast, don't look at anyone

Pull up my shirt collar and pull down the sleeve

And lower my hemline

I stare at a smaller screen now

Going through others' exciting lives

As I pull up close to home

And shut myself in my room

Till the next day

Get up, do it all over again.
