A few boats cross sight

Still, no diamonds on their masts


And yet, when the sun touches the horizon,

One never knows which one sinks

But still there's faith

That the one with you and I won't

The calmest of seas can stir up a storm

And then no shape, no flow, no form

Not a soul could cross the stone solicitous seas,

Had it not been for his boat in the crease

And so he sails,

With no home, no hope

Praying to the faint moon, the morning sun

May she hear his call,

And blow like the summer breeze.

Not a breath could reach his lips

If her faith could not be kissed

And so he sails till the end of time

To find what he'd lost

What once was mine

With his belief his only navigation

His faith, his only hope

Life, what he may not be able to experience again,

Still feels worth living for.
