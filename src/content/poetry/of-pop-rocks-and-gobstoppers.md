It's when I gaze at the barely visible stars in the night time sky,

and stretch all I can to touch the swing pole with my stubby fingers,

trying to reach as high as possible,

that I understand it's still there.

It's every time I skip a step to a made up tune,

and do a little pirouette when I turn to a song in my head,

trying to brighten up the most monotonous of walks,

that I know it's still there.

It's whenever I gobble a spoonful of sugar,

and snap hakuna matata to all the lemons that life throws at me,

trying to build a whole new world with a new exciting point of view,

that I believe, slightly more, in just how far it'll go,

reminding myself that I must never let it go.

And it's every time I slurp up the remains of ramen,

and stare at the clouds from the window of a moving car,

that I appreciate its negligible existence.

For no matter how many years I pile on,

or the layers of social acceptance that I try to hide within,

I know that I will always love this little part of me,

the child inside that will always live.
