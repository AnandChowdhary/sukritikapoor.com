She closes her eyes and lets out a long sigh of relief;

A whisper of her beloved and a promise to never be broken resounds in her ears.

Slowly, her worries seem to fade away

as she dives deeper into the inner realm of her thoughts.

She touches her waist,

like that familiar embrace that spread warmth through every inch of her body.

The tear she has been holding back lightly caresses her cheek

and slowly, her lips,

like the kiss she has been longing for.

She breathes deeper and continues to fall into this trance

enkindled by the pain of Viraha that seems to be spreading farther through her veins with every second,

overwhelming her, yet calming her down.

She trembles,

like all those nights she lay in the arms of her beloved,

partaking in the euphoric ecstasy of communion,

that suddenly ceases to leave her breathless.

Her fingers seem to perform a convulsive dance on her delicate skin,

only to finally culminate her prolonged yearning.

She heaves another sigh of relief for the last time

as she slowly transcends the boundaries of consciousness

and falls into a deep slumber,

never to be disturbed.
