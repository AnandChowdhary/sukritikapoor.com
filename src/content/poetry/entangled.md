I feel myself falling deeper into your thoughts

as you race through my mind and force me to shift perspectives

to a fabricated understanding of myself.

A mere mirage of being in control

that you seem to have orchestrated

leads me through winding alleys of this mind palace.

For here, there is no road not taken, and yet a blinding number of possibilities.

I try to get myself to wake up.

Wake up from this lucid dream where I am just another brick in the wall

to another narrative that you present for my gratification.

And yet it always seems to fall short of my own indulgences,

weaved about from the delicate threads of your id

as you move through me like a wave of current.

And now again you seem to eviscerate me

till I am nothing but a hollow shell that moves in acquiescence.

Building a constant debt inside of me that I can't seem to fulfill without your being.

And slowly, you take over my core,

to surround the candle to my consciousness,

till alas, I no longer exist alone.
