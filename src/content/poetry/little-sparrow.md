Stay near, little sparrow, for they might cut your flight

Caged within darkness, freedom lies.

Not your stolen feather nor your broken wing

Could ever ink your sky.

Stay close, for hunger is their disguise.


A show of flesh, a touch of skin and myriad voices rung by

Hunger gleams, eyes flutter, yet no one hears their cry.

Muttered words and hidden voices mar another sight

A fire is lit, a womb slit and ashes flow nearby.


Stay near, little sparrow, for even a misty dawn

Carries the legacy of a turbulent night

The treacherous rays of a burning sun will only burn your day

Fear, for if not, it's not too far away.

Stay close, little one, let it not be today.


Remember remember, a soon forgotten tale

Unknown as it were, spoken of everyday.

A harbinger of hope yet ruthlessly torn away

The torment of the crouching dove, igniting only his lust

Remember remember, the hidden dragon had won.


Stay near, little sparrow, for clemency is not your right.

Every step taken, every breath drawn, every moment frozen in time,

The remnant of every soul beseeched from them

Is their largesse not their plight.

Hold true to my word and listen carefully child,

Stay close, forever or forever lose your light.


The sin of existence, perpetrated, may never be exculpated

For even Odysseus couldn't touch the horizon of truth.

So, for the last time, I beg you my little one,

Stay near, for your journey is but futile

Stay close, my little sparrow, stay here, stay nigh…
