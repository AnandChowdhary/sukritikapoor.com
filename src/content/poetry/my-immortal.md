A spark ignited and a soul left untouched

A fire started but the glow left unseen


Smoke filled his thoughts and with it blew them away

It was an empty mind;

A creation to be made and a destruction to be avoided

But what was already burnt could not be saved

The ashes of which he could not find


For he tried to find the glow, amidst himself in the fire

A scarlet flame and blood that ran

Spreading warmth through the amber wood

But all that his searching eyes could see

Were just the remains of a spent pyre


Her words came back to him,

"Wouldn't you look for me if I ever go away?"

And there he stood, amongst a pile of ash

Looking for her, searching for her, yet finding her right by his side

He replied, "I wouldn't ever let you go."


A spark ignited and a soul left untouched

A fire started but the glow left unseen


The sombre of the morning sun brought to him a nebulous life

And the frost that had settled gave way to haze

But he stood there, waiting

Waiting for her warmth to embrace him again


She wiped his tears and she held his hand

Yet his empty hand stroked his wet cheek

And as her fingers entwined around his

His trembling fingers held up his shaking knees


Yet her voice was all that he could hear

And her face, all that could be seen

As he stood there amongst a pile of ash

Looking for her, searching for her, yet finding her right by his side


A spark ignited and a soul left untouched

A fire started but the glow left unseen


The time for him was ticking closer

And every bead of his sweat drew it nearer

His reluctant feet wouldn't lift and his hands wouldn't shift

His every breath pulled him towards her


In every grain of sand that blew away

A part of him was being lost

Trying to hold on to all that he could

Yet she kept calling him, pulling him closer

To be one and to be free


And so for the last time, he held her hand

Never to let go again

As he stood there amongst a pile of ash

Looking for her, searching for her, yet finding her right by his side


A spark ignited and a soul left untouched

A fire started but the glow left unseen
