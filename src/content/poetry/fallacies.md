It's when the trimmings and finery slowly come off,

revealing a glimmer of bare skin underneath,

seemingly simple, wearing one's own.

Where layered up in borrowed bedizened garbs

they are marked out as otherworldly, only for owning

not themselves, not their wealth, or even their possessions

but an ostensible fame,

the existence of which hangs loosely from a thread of notoriety.

For when they march out on coloured carpets,

looking campy yet in uniform gowns of tulle and metal;

all reaching for higher levels of distinction in a disconcerting congruence

as men and women walk beside them

with simple jobs of turning their trails and vanishing into thin air,

only to be noticed for their astonishing non-existence

and so they pose in a combined effort to turn heads at their quotidian lives

to the edges that swarm with crowds

that aim to lose more of their own identity, to pick up the thrown pieces

and become an amalgamation of discarded identities.

For when worn off pieces are sold off as avant-garde

that bring back ideals of a long gone era

for the less breathable is the epitome of beauty,

and their minimal efforts at highlighting the casual comfortable

are applauded as voices rising against an illusory tyranny.

For they set up their own big brothers in opulent dystopian worlds

That shun the ordinary—for being just that.

That how mysteriously unremarkable is their facade of appearances

that inaccessible is now the new modest,

and modest is none.
