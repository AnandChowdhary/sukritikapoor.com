There

She heard the river echo again

There

A thousand arms moved as one, uplifting a candelabrum of flames into the sky

Announcing to the world, their devotion and to her, their declaration


There,

She once again stood, facing her decision to be one with the flames

And so she drowned to rise up once again.
