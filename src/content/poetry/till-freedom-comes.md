And so she waits, for one more dawn that at dusk won't turn to rust

For time is all she can hope for, the future that one day sets her free

Of love and emotion

Of her guilt

Her devotion

Her utopian dream of life once again

Spun once more on the creator's wheel

Maybe this time it will be different?

For the stars that confine her fate

Ruthlessly abound her

Shattered by his hand, inked in their blood

Lies the bond she could never break

For lines drawn on her hand cannot be changed

By mere thoughts of escape

Anything else

Alas, but a sin

She couldn't commit for hope would be too real

All that's left is wait

For one more dawn that at dusk won't turn to rust

And her life will be hers to end
