        I'm Sukriti, a writer and editor who breathes, sleeps, and lives for the
        intricate world of words. I live in the land of windmills and
        stroopwafels, and love to travel to new countries, explore new cultures,
        and meet new people.

        I'm currently working as a content writer at Eurail. I'm also a
        voracious reader, sometimes like to cook, and am always up for dancing
        to early 2000s, pop, or Bollywood music.
